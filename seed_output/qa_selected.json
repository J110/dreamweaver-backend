The ancient map showed Venus bright, And Jupiter's majestic light, Each planet danced in painted gold, With stories that the Maya told. As Diego traced each starry line, He saw how all the stars align, Like friends who come from far and near, To make the night sky bright and clear. He learned that just like stars above, We're connected through our love, Each friendship is a shining light, That guides us through the darkest night. Now Diego knows he's not alone, The stars and friends have always shown, That in this cosmic, vast embrace, We each have found our special place.",

The harvest moon was rising bright and high, The celebration drums would fill the sky, But Amara's heart let out a worried sigh— She dreamed to paint the rhythm, but didn't know why. \"I'll journey far to find the perfect beat, To paint the sounds that make our lives complete!\" With pigments mixed and brushes at her feet, She set out on her quest through morning's heat. Past thundering falls where waters danced and played, Through grasslands where the zebras grazed and stayed, She listened close to every sound that swayed, The rhythm of the earth that nature made. The elephants stomped out a steady thrum, The birds sang melodies to morning's sun, But still she felt her quest was not yet done, The celebration rhythm hadn't come. As evening stars began to softly gleam, She sat beside a gently flowing stream, And heard her heartbeat like a distant dream— The rhythm she'd been seeking, pure and clean. She rushed back home with colors bright and true, And painted drums in every brilliant hue, The celebration started, voices grew, Her heart-rhythm painting made the music new. Now when the harvest moon shines overhead, And all the village children go to bed, They dream of Amara's journey widespread, Where art and music beautifully wed.",

She traced the paths of wandering lights, Those planets dancing their orbital song, Calculating distances through countless nights, Wondering where in this dance she belonged. The elders gathered when she shared her sight, How Venus rises before the dawn, How Jupiter's moons eclipse its light, How stellar wisdom can guide us on. \"You are the keeper of cosmic truth,\" Her grandmother smiled with ancient grace, \"Your gift connects our people's youth To the infinite wisdom of time and space.\" The tribe prepared a celebration grand, With drums that echoed the pulsar's beat, And Amara, with her steady hand, Made star-maps where science and spirit meet. As firelight danced beneath the dome Of countless suns in velvet night, Amara knew she'd found her home— A bridge between earth's warmth and stellar light. Now when you gaze at stars above, Remember Amara's gift so true: That science blooms from wonder's love, And the cosmos celebrates in you.",

Her grandmother's tales would flow of magic in the ice and snow, Of compasses carved from ancient stone, that never left a soul alone. One dawn when frost adorned her breath, she ventured past the village rest, To hunting grounds her fathers knew, where ice ran deep and crystal blue. Beneath a ridge of glacial might, she glimpsed a soft ethereal light, A compass made of ice so pure, its magic ancient and secure. The needle spun with starlight gleams, revealing more than what it seems, Not north or south, but bonds of heart, connections that would never part. It showed her friend across the bay, though storms had kept her friend away, Their friendship strong through winter's test, their spirits joined from east to west. She learned the compass held the truth that friendship is eternal youth, Through seasons harsh and distances wide, true friends remain close by your side. The ancient magic in the ice reflected bonds that never splice, A discovery profound and deep, that warmed her heart and soul to keep. Now when the Arctic winds blow strong, and winter nights seem far too long, Siku holds her compass near, and feels her friendship crystal clear. The magic lives in hearts that care, in bonds that time can never wear.",

Ek din milе Luna, mermaid so kind, Aur Zephyr wind-sprite, pure of mind. Together they explored crystal caves deep, Sharing stories, promises to keep. Floating bridges of light unhe connect karte, Different islands, hearts ko reflect karte. Kiran ne sikha, friendship ka magic true, Distance doesn't matter, when hearts are blue. Starfish lanterns light up the night, Friends gather 'round, everything's right. Samudar ki waves, gentle lullaby sing, Dosti ki warmth, peaceful dreams bring. Now Kiran sleeps on his island home, No more alone, no need to roam. Sapno mein friends, always near, Future's bright, nothing to fear.",
