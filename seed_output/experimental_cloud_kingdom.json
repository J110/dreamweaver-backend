  "text": "[GENTLE] There are places in the world that most people never see. Hidden between the folds of sunset clouds, tucked above the tallest mountains, is a kingdom made entirely of mist and moonlight. They call it the Cloud Kingdom. And in its very center, rising like a tower of silver fog, stands the oldest building in all the sky\u2014the Dream Library.\n\nNow, the Dream Library is no ordinary library. It doesn't hold stories written on paper. Instead, every book on its shelves is a dream\u2014a real, living dream, swirling with color and sound, waiting to be borrowed by children at bedtime. For as long as anyone could remember, the Library had never lost a single book.\n\n[CURIOUS] Until now.\n\n[PAUSE] Mira noticed it first. She was ten\u2014well, almost ten, she'd say, because her birthday was only three weeks away\u2014and she was the youngest apprentice the Dream Library had ever had. Her job was simple: every evening, she'd walk the aisles, checking that each book was humming softly on its shelf. A humming book was a healthy book. A silent shelf meant trouble.\n\n[DRAMATIC_PAUSE] That Tuesday, Shelf Nineteen was silent.\n\n\"That's strange,\" Mira said, frowning. She ran her finger along the empty space where a thick, blue-glowing book used to sit. The Dream of the Singing Whale. Gone. Not checked out, not misplaced. Just\u2026 gone.\n\n[EXCITED] She rushed to tell Keeper Aldric, the elderly librarian who'd watched over the Dream Library for longer than most clouds lasted. He was a tall, thin man who moved slowly, spoke even more slowly, and had the kind of deep, calm voice that made you feel like everything would eventually be fine.\n\n[CHAR_START]\"Keeper Aldric! The Singing Whale dream is missing!\"[CHAR_END] Mira burst through his office door, nearly tripping over a stack of star charts.\n\n[GENTLE] Aldric looked up from his desk, his silver spectacles sliding down his nose. [CHAR_START]\"Missing, you say? Hmm. That is\u2026 unexpected.\"[CHAR_END] He said it so calmly that for a moment, Mira wondered if she was overreacting.\n\n[CURIOUS] But the next morning, three more books were gone. The Dream of the Firefly Forest. The Dream of the Chocolate River. The Dream of the Laughing Stars. Empty shelves, no sound, no glow. Just dark, quiet gaps where stories used to live.\n\n\"That's seven books this week,\" Mira said, scribbling notes in her journal. She'd started keeping track. \"And they're all from the Deep Shelves\u2014the oldest dreams in the collection.\"\n\n[EXCITED] Aldric stroked his long beard, which was the color of storm clouds. [CHAR_START]\"The Deep Shelves. Yes. Those are the dreams from the Time Before Clocks. Very old indeed. If they're disappearing\u2026\"[CHAR_END] He trailed off, which was worse than if he'd finished the sentence.\n\n\"If they're disappearing, what?\" Mira pressed.\n\n[GENTLE] Aldric looked at her over his spectacles. [CHAR_START]\"Then perhaps it's time someone went down to the Archives. Where the oldest dreams are kept.\"[CHAR_END]\n\n\"The Archives?\" Mira's eyes went wide. She'd heard of the Archives\u2014every apprentice had\u2014but she'd never been there. They were deep beneath the Library, carved into the cloud itself, in tunnels so old that even the walls dreamed.\n\n[CURIOUS] [CHAR_START]\"But Keeper, nobody's been to the Archives in\u2014\"[CHAR_END]\n\n[CHAR_START]\"Forty years,\"[CHAR_END] Aldric finished. [CHAR_START]\"I went once, when I was not much older than you. The path is\u2026 quiet. Very quiet. You'll need a clear mind and steady feet. And most importantly\u2014\"[CHAR_END] he held up a finger\u2014 [CHAR_START]\"you must listen. The Archives speak, but only to those who are truly still.\"[CHAR_END]\n\nHe handed her a small glass lantern that glowed faintly blue. \"This will light your way. It runs on breath\u2014the calmer you breathe, the brighter it shines.\"\n\n[PAUSE] Mira took the lantern. It was warm in her hands, and she could feel it pulsing gently, like a tiny heartbeat.\n\n\"I'll find the books,\" she said quietly. \"I promise.\"\n\n[PHASE_2]\n\n[CALM] The entrance to the Archives was a narrow doorway behind the last bookshelf on the lowest floor. Mira pushed it open and stepped through into a long, spiraling staircase that wound downward into soft, pearl-colored mist.\n\nEach step she took made no sound at all. The stairs were made of cloud-stuff, dense enough to walk on but soft as cotton underfoot. [PAUSE] The air was cool and still, and somewhere far below, she could hear a faint hum\u2014like a song being sung very far away.\n\nMira held up her lantern. It flickered. She remembered what Aldric had said: the calmer you breathe, the brighter it shines. [BREATH_CUE] So she took a long, slow breath in through her nose\u2014filling her lungs all the way up\u2014and then let it out through her mouth, slow and steady, like blowing across the top of a bottle.\n\nThe lantern glowed brighter.\n\n[CALM] Good. She kept walking. The staircase spiraled down and down, and with each turn, the mist grew thicker and warmer. It wasn't cold down here\u2014it was the opposite, actually. Like being wrapped in a blanket that had been sitting in the sun.\n\n[PAUSE] After what felt like a hundred steps, the staircase opened into a vast, quiet chamber. The ceiling was so high that Mira couldn't see it. The walls were lined with shelves, but these weren't like the shelves upstairs. These were ancient\u2014carved from petrified cloud, smooth and pale as marble.\n\nAnd on them sat the oldest dreams in existence.\n\n[SLEEPY] They weren't glowing like the books upstairs. These dreams were dim, like embers in a fireplace that had been burning all night. But they were still warm. Mira could feel their heat on her face as she walked past them.\n\n[CALM] The hum was louder here. It seemed to come from the walls themselves, a deep, resonant vibration that Mira could feel in her chest. It was the sound of very old stories, still alive, still breathing.\n\n[BREATH_CUE] Mira paused and took another slow breath. In through the nose\u2026 long and deep\u2026 then out through the mouth\u2026 soft as a whisper. Her lantern pulsed steadily now, casting blue light across the ancient shelves.\n\nThat's when she saw it.\n\n[CALM] In the very center of the chamber, at the end of a long aisle, sat an enormous book\u2014bigger than any dream she'd ever seen. It rested on a stone pedestal, and its cover seemed to shift and ripple, like the surface of a lake at twilight.\n\nAnd all around it, floating in slow circles, were the missing dreams.\n\n[GENTLE] The Singing Whale. The Firefly Forest. The Chocolate River. The Laughing Stars. All of them, drifting gently through the air like leaves on a still pond. They weren't lost at all. They were\u2026 coming home.\n\n[SLEEPY] Mira stepped closer. The great book's cover shimmered, and she could read its title, written in letters that seemed to glow from within: The First Dream.\n\n[CALM] \"The First Dream,\" she whispered. She'd read about this in Aldric's oldest journals. It was the very first story ever dreamed by a sleeping child, thousands of years ago. All other dreams had grown from it, like branches from a tree. And now the oldest dreams were returning to their source.\n\n[BREATH_CUE] Mira sat down on the soft, cloud-stone floor. She crossed her legs and let her shoulders drop. In through the nose\u2026 slow\u2026 steady\u2026 out through the mouth\u2026 like the tide pulling back from the shore.\n\n[GENTLE] \"You're not stealing them,\" she said softly to the great book. \"You're just\u2026 remembering them.\"\n\nThe book hummed\u2014a deep, warm sound, like a cello playing a single, long note. The floating dreams pulsed in response, their colors brightening for a moment before settling back to a soft glow.\n\n[SLEEPY] Mira understood now. The oldest dreams needed to rest. They'd been on the shelves for so long, telling their stories night after night, year after year. They were tired. And so they'd drifted back to the First Dream\u2014back to where all stories begin\u2014to rest, to recharge, to dream their own dreams.\n\n[CALM] She watched them float in their slow, peaceful circles. The Singing Whale dream brushed past her, and for just a moment, she could hear it\u2014a deep, gentle whale song, far away and beautiful. [PAUSE] The Firefly Forest dream drifted by, and she smelled pine needles and saw tiny golden lights dancing behind her eyelids.\n\n[SLEEPY] Each dream that passed left her feeling a little heavier, a little warmer, a little more still. It was as if the dreams were sharing their tiredness with her\u2014not in a bad way, but in the way that a warm room and a soft chair make you want to close your eyes.\n\n[BREATH_CUE] She breathed again, slowly. In\u2026 and out\u2026 Her body felt heavy against the cloud-stone floor, which was surprisingly comfortable\u2014soft and warm and perfectly shaped, like a cushion that knew exactly where she needed support.\n\n[GENTLE] \"I'll tell Aldric,\" she murmured. \"The dreams are safe. They just needed to sleep.\"\n\nThe great book hummed again, softer this time. The floating dreams seemed to slow their orbits, drifting lower, closer to the book, like children gathering around a fire on a cold night.\n\n[PHASE_3]\n\n[SLEEPY] Everything in the chamber was slowing down now. [LONG_PAUSE] The dreams drifted in their circles, slower\u2026 and slower\u2026 and slower. Like the last leaves of autumn, settling one by one onto still water.\n\n[WHISPERING] The hum of the First Dream was so low now that Mira felt it more than heard it. A vibration in the floor beneath her. In the air around her. In her own chest, rising and falling with each breath. [LONG_PAUSE]\n\n[SLEEPY] One by one, the floating dreams came to rest. The Singing Whale settled onto a shelf, its blue glow dimming to a soft pulse. [LONG_PAUSE] The Firefly Forest drifted down beside it, its golden lights blinking slower\u2026 slower\u2026 slower\u2026 [LONG_PAUSE]\n\n[WHISPERING] The air was so warm now. So still. Like the moment just before dawn, when the whole world holds its breath. [LONG_PAUSE]\n\n[SLEEPY] The Chocolate River dream settled onto its shelf with a sound like a sigh. Its brown and golden swirls slowed\u2026 slowed\u2026 until they were barely moving at all. [LONG_PAUSE] The Laughing Stars dream floated down beside it, its tiny lights going out one by one\u2026 one\u2026 by\u2026 one\u2026 [LONG_PAUSE]\n\n[SLEEPY] Mira's lantern dimmed to almost nothing\u2014not because her breathing was wrong, but because the chamber itself was growing quieter. Even the light wanted to rest. [LONG_PAUSE]\n\n[WHISPERING] She could feel the warmth of the cloud-stone floor beneath her\u2026 soft and steady\u2026 like being held. Her hands rested in her lap\u2026 heavy and still. [LONG_PAUSE] Her shoulders had dropped. She couldn't remember when that had happened. They just\u2026 let go. [LONG_PAUSE]\n\n[SLEEPY] The last few dreams drifted down from the air. A dream of a moonlit garden\u2026 settling softly. [LONG_PAUSE] A dream of rain on a warm roof\u2026 coming to rest. [LONG_PAUSE] A dream of a cat curled by a window\u2026 tucking itself onto a shelf\u2026 and going still. [LONG_PAUSE]\n\n[WHISPERING] All the dreams were resting now. Every single one. [LONG_PAUSE] The shelves glowed softly\u2026 pulsing\u2026 like slow breathing\u2026 in\u2026 and out\u2026 in\u2026 and out\u2026 [LONG_PAUSE]\n\n[SLEEPY] Mira leaned back against the pedestal. The cloud-stone was so warm against her back. Her whole body felt heavy now\u2026 pleasantly heavy\u2026 like she was sinking into the softest bed in the world. [LONG_PAUSE]\n\n[WHISPERING] She could still hear the hum\u2026 so faint now\u2026 like a song heard through a wall\u2026 through a pillow\u2026 through a dream. [LONG_PAUSE]\n\n[WHISPERING] The chamber was perfectly still. [LONG_PAUSE] Perfectly warm. [LONG_PAUSE] Perfectly quiet. [LONG_PAUSE]\n\n[WHISPERING] Mira's eyes closed. Not because she decided to close them\u2026 but because they were so heavy\u2026 so comfortable\u2026 that staying open seemed like too much work. [LONG_PAUSE]\n\n[WHISPERING] The First Dream hummed its lowest note\u2026 a sound like the earth turning\u2026 slow and deep and endless. [LONG_PAUSE]\n\n[WHISPERING] And all around her\u2026 the dreams slept. [LONG_PAUSE] Rows and rows of quiet shelves\u2026 [LONG_PAUSE] each one glowing\u2026 just barely\u2026 like stars seen through closed eyelids. [LONG_PAUSE]\n\n[WHISPERING] Warm\u2026 and still\u2026 and safe\u2026 [LONG_PAUSE]\n\n[WHISPERING] The library quiet\u2026 [LONG_PAUSE] the shelves breathing softly\u2026 [LONG_PAUSE] the mist curling\u2026 slow as smoke\u2026 [LONG_PAUSE]\n\n[WHISPERING] One page turning\u2026 in the dream wind\u2026 [LONG_PAUSE] then another\u2026 [LONG_PAUSE] then another\u2026 [LONG_PAUSE]\n\n[WHISPERING] Soft\u2026 [LONG_PAUSE] and warm\u2026 [LONG_PAUSE] and still\u2026 [LONG_PAUSE]\n\n[WHISPERING] Rest now\u2026 [LONG_PAUSE]\n\n[WHISPERING] Sleep\u2026 [LONG_PAUSE]",
